# Notes on examples #

## 1) bond1.py ##
 example of manipulations with graph using API

## 2) test1 ... ##

test1, test1-1 
same graph same task, but searched first by BFS then by ASTAR algorythim without any limitations.
Results re different - but difference is insignificant. 
Expected - results shalbe the same

test2
added line to prevent following line called "q"

test3 
remove i-n edge type p
add e-o and o-n edges type p

new path is longer - see test3.pdf

test3-1 
we revesed one edge - assign it type p but result has same path (es expected)
directed search is used. and it works

##3 triplets

triplets_1 - search between two handlesw/o limitations
triplets_2 - make a limitation -- disallow rdf:type
triplets_2_1 -different output - clarify
triplets_3 - disallow http://..is_admin_c_of

this s current (Dec-17-22) state of "exclude branch in A* algorithm
